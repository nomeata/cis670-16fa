# Sept 8, 2016

+ Keep signing up for lecture topics!

+ Keep thinking off semester projects. Don't forget that you can work in groups!

+ Keep reading Ch4.v and start looking at the exercises in Ch5.v and Ch6.v.
  Also read PFPL chapters 4-6.

+ Don't forget to send questions before EACH class.


# Questions

# Other questions

+  I have been reading Chapter 3 and 4 of PFPL and found the same symbol
   ⊢ in both chapters, representing derivability judgement of statements
   and typing in language E. Is it an instance of Curry–Howard
   correspondence between derivations and typings?

+ I've often wanted to do something like "pick fresh x in L", "let x be ...",
etc. But I haven't been sufficiently well-versed with the tactic language and
CIC to go about doing it. Would you be going through this in class?

+ In the draft version of the book, in chapter 4.3, page 38, the author
  commented on the weakening lemma saying that from a programming point of
  view, the weakening property allows programmers to add new variables and it
  won't break the existing program. However, in the footnote, there were also
  comments about systems that don't obey the weakening property yet they are
  still useful. I am wondering what interesting capabilities that these
  substructural systems might have over systems that do obey the weakening
  property? It seems to be such a fundamental law for any programming language
  and I can't really think of cases where not having this property can be
  useful.

On top of that, it seems the weakening property, substitution property and the
decomposition property together tells us that the simple language described in
chapter 4 is type-safe. Are these the required properties for a language to
have to be called type-safe? Can a language violate some of them yet still be
called type-safe?

+ Homework exercise:

     Lemma subst_open : forall (x : atom) u e1 e2,
          lc u ->
          open ([x ~> u] e1) e2 = [x ~> u] (open e1 e2).
     Proof.
     (* EXERCISE *) Admitted.

  Say e2 = exp_fvar x, e1 = exp_bvar 0.
  So ([x ~> u]) e1 = e1 = exp_bvar 0. open ([x ~> u] e1) e2 = e2 = exp_fvar x.
  Again, (open e1 e2) = exp_fvar x. So [x ~> u] (open e1 e2) = u.
  Now exp_fvar x is not necessarily equal to u. How do we resolve this?

  [Answer: Good catch! The original version of the file had a bug. Do a git pull
   for the correct version. ]

+ In Ch4.v, you chose to use a list to represent the environment. Why did you
  choose list over other data structures? And in particular, why did you
  choose list over map? I haven’t tried using maps in this file (maybe I
  will), but maps look like a more natural representation: you don’t need to
  worry if it is `uniq`, and the order does not matter to it.

+ You state that "If we view typing contexts as ordered lists of typing
  assumptions, then the type system shown in section 4.2 of PFPL does NOT
  satisfy the weakening property" after the statement of weakening. I'm not
  quite sure what is meant by this. Does it mean that we can only use the types
  in the context in a certain order? What kind of type system does this
  describe?

+ In Ch4.v, the section about typing judgements has quite a few lemma whose
  proof would be difficult to go through if we state them in their natural
  form, and they are often generalized to a stronger version in order to guide
  Coq. However, this technique seems to require quite a lot of experience in
  navigating the design space of strengthening lemmas as there seems to be no
  hard and fast rule. Do you have some advice on how to identify a situation
  on where we might need a generalized theorem? And is there some heuristics
  that we may try when trying to generalize theorems?


+ I find that we use `atom` with free variables and `nat` with bounded
  variables. Are there situations in which using `nat` with free variables that
  are more useful than `atom`?
