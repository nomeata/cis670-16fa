## Administrivia:

+ Sign up for lecture topics!  See potential chapters from PFPL that would
  make good lecture topics after the schedule on the [homepage](../README.md). If you are
  taking this course for credit, please pick one of these and let me know so I
  can set up the schedule for the rest of the semester.

+ Start thinking of semester projects. Sign up for an individual/small
  group meeting with me during the next two weeks to start brainstorming
  (http://meetme.so/stephanieweirich) or send me an email to arrange another
  time.


+ Coq status? Has everyone installed Coq? Making progress on [Ch4.v](../code/Ch4.v)?


+ Keep reading through Ch4.v through the end.

## Today's Goal:

Back to [locally nameless representation](../code/Ch4.v) and reasoning about syntax in Coq.
